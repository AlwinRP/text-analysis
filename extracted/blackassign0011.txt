has changed the ways in which we work, interact, and communicate with one another. the demand for internet connectivity is expected to reach previously unheard-of heights by the year 2035 when every person on the planet will be linked. this article discusses the developing alternatives that will reshape the digital environment in india and around the world as well as the effects of this rise in internet demand on communications. the essay emphasizes how digital communication channels including social networking platforms, video conferencing tools, and instant messaging apps will overtake traditional communication routes in the future. the telecommunications sector will meet this growing demand with the shift to 5g and beyond, allowing seamless connectivity for iot devices and building the foundation for smart cities and driverless vehicles. introduction: the way we interact, work and live has been completely changed by the internet. the demand for the internet has grown exponentially since its inception, and this trend is expected to continue in the coming years. by 2035, the world’s population will be even more connected, and india, the largest economy and technology hub, will have a major impact on the development of the digital environment worldwide. this article examines how demand for the internet is growing, how it affects communication, and how new options are emerging that will transform the digital world by 2035. an ioe ecosystem will be created by integrating ai into the internet, personalizing user experiences and improving services. to shape this digital future and foster a connected, secure and efficient global community, this article highlights india’s role as a technology hub. increase in internet demand the internet has influenced many facets of modern culture and has become an indispensable component of it. the need for internet access has increased dramatically as a result of the widespread use of smartphones, iot devices, and other technological breakthroughs. it is anticipated that almost everyone will have access to the internet by 2035, regardless of location. due to the exponential rise in data consumption that will ensue, a reliable communications infrastructure will be needed to meet the rising demands. communications effect our communication habits will change dramatically as internet usage increases. as consumers prefer fast and digital communication techniques, traditional communication channels like telephones and postal services will continue to lose prominence. the communication landscape will be dominated by social media platforms, messaging services, and video conferencing capabilities, allowing for global real-time connections. ahead of 5g: the transition the telecommunications sector is moving toward 5g and beyond to meet the growth in internet demand. 5g networks, which provide unmatched data rates and low latency, will be widely used by 2035. the internet of things (iot) will be seamlessly connected thanks to this technical advance, ushering in the era of smart cities and driverless automobiles. the telecommunications sector is preparing to take a huge step forward with the launch of 5g technology and beyond as the demand for internet connectivity continues to soar. 5g networks are anticipated to offer unheard-of data rates, decreased latency, and increased network capacity by the year 2035. satellite internet’s emergence satellite internet will revolutionize isolated and rural locations with limited access to existing communication infrastructure. the most remote regions of india and the entire world will have access to high-speed internet thanks to breakthroughs in satellite technology and falling costs. by doing this, the digital divide will be closed, and underserved areas will experience economic growth. when it comes to bridging the connectivity gap between remote rural areas and urban areas, satellite internet will be essential. satellite technology will make it possible for communities without or with little access to traditional communication infrastructure to engage in the digital economy and have access to government programs, healthcare services, and educational resources. the decentralized internet and blockchain blockchain technology will replace the current centralized internet model by 2035. the decentralized nature of blockchain will improve data ownership, security, and privacy. users’ access to and control over their data will expand, which will boost confidence in online interactions and transactions. finance, healthcare, and supply chain are just a few of the industries that decentralized apps (d apps) will disrupt. online information and transactions will become transparent and unchangeable thanks to the blockchain’s decentralized ledger architecture. blockchain will improve consumer, business, and institutional trust by supplying a tamper-proof history of data, eliminating the need for middlemen in a number of operations. internet security and quantum technology quantum internet will offer an unheard-of level of security as cyber threats become more advanced. unbreakable encryption provided by quantum communication protects sensitive data from future cyberattacks. quantum networks will be an essential part of critical infrastructure and data-sensitive sectors by 2035. qkd, a cutting-edge cryptographic method that permits the secure exchange of encryption keys between parties, will be used by quantum internet. because qkd uses the principles of quantum mechanics, unlike conventional encryption techniques, it is nearly impossible for eavesdroppers to intercept or decode the transferred keys. the internet of everything and ai an ecosystem known as the internet of everything (ioe) will be created by the deep integration of artificial intelligence (ai) into the internet. personalization of user experiences, service optimization, and work automation are all possible with ai-powered hardware and software. the ioe will transform sectors like healthcare, education, and entertainment by 2035. as ai becomes increasingly ingrained in the ioe and internet environment, issues over data privacy will grow more pressing. for legislators and tech businesses, finding a balance between providing individualized experiences and safeguarding user data will be quite difficult. through individualized learning routes and intelligent tutoring systems, ai will improve the learning experience in the education industry. platforms for adaptive learning will meet the needs of each individual student, improving inclusivity and effectiveness in the classroom. there will be a greater emphasis on utilizing these technologies to solve climate change as the ioe and ai grow in popularity. ai-powered systems will be used to manage natural resources, monitor environmental changes, and optimize energy consumption. security and privacy concerns the likelihood of cyberwarfare and cyberattacks on a global and national level increases as internet usage increases. cybersecurity will dominate national security agendas by 2035. in order to safeguard vital infrastructure, avoid data breaches, and combat online threats posed by adversaries, governments and companies will make significant investments in cyber defence and offensive capabilities. by 2035, machine learning algorithms will be used by ai-powered cybersecurity systems to quickly identify and counteract advanced cyber threats. the ability of these intelligent systems to recognize and mitigate potential threats will continuously increase as they learn from fresh attack patterns. digital inclusion and bridging the divide bridging the gap between urban and rural communities is one of the major obstacles in the fight against the digital divide. governments and organizations will put into place thorough plans by 2035 to bring affordable and dependable internet connection to remote areas. the immense prospects provided by the internet will be accessible to even the most remote locations thanks to projects like satellite internet, community networks, and mobile connectivity projects. mobile internet will be essential for providing last-mile connection by 2035. internet access will be possible in places where traditional fixed-line infrastructure is not practical thanks to mobile networks and technological breakthroughs. people in remote areas will be able to access information, education, and employment prospects thanks to mobile data subscriptions and reasonably priced cell phones. conclusion by the year 2035, both in india and globally, the communications landscape will be shaped by the explosive growth of internet demand. there will be an unprecedented amount of connectivity and data consumption as a result of the digital revolution, the expansion of smart gadgets, the internet of things, and developing technologies. with the transition from old methods to real-time, digital interactions via social media platforms, messaging applications, and video conferencing technologies, communications will undergo a fundamental upheaval. the growth of smart cities and autonomous vehicles will be fuelled by seamless connectivity and iot integration as 5g networks become the standard. despite technological developments, there is an increasing need to close the digital divide and guarantee that all communities have access to the internet. while cybersecurity and privacy protections will be of the utmost importance in preserving sensitive data, sustainable and environmentally friendly solutions will be sought to lessen the internet’s environmental impact. we can use the power of the
